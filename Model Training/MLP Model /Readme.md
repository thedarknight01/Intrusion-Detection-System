# Intrusion Detection System using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
This project implements a neural network model to detect and classify network intrusions from the NSL-KDD dataset. The model is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## 📋 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a robust classifier that can distinguish between normal network traffic and various types of cyber attacks. The script performs the following key tasks:

- Data Loading: Ingests the NSL-KDD training and testing datasets.
- Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the data by encoding categorical features and scaling numerical values.
- Model Building: Constructs a Sequential MLP model using Keras.
- Training: Trains the model on the preprocessed training data.
- Evaluation: Assesses the model's performance on the test set and generates a classification report and a confusion matrix.

## 💾 Dataset

This model is trained on the NSL-KDD Dataset, a benchmark dataset for intrusion detection research.
###### Link : [NSL-KDD](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd)
- KDDTrain+.txt: The training dataset.
- KDDTest+.txt: The testing dataset.

  _Both files are included in this directory for easy setup and execution._

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/thedarknight01/Intrusion-Detection-System.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Intrusion-Detection-System/Model\ Training/MLP\ Model/
```
Install the required libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
💡Once the setup is complete, you can run the model training and evaluation script.

📊 Expected Output
The script will produce the following:

Console Output: You will see the model's summary, training progress for 20 epochs, and a final classification report showing precision, recall, and F1-scores for each attack category.

Confusion Matrix Image: A file named confusion_matrix.png will be saved in the directory. This image visually represents the model's performance in classifying the different attack types.

## Conclusion

DoS → Precision 0.95, Recall 0.77
→ The model is very confident when it says “DoS,” but it still misses some.

Normal → Recall 0.98
→ Almost all normal traffic is caught, but precision is only 0.65 (lots of false alarms).

Probe → Moderate results (F1 ~0.70).

R2L → Precision 0.91 but Recall 0.01 
→ The model almost never detects R2L attacks.

U2R → Precision decent (0.78) but Recall 0.31.
→ Again, it misses most of these rare attacks

This model is failed for R2L and U2R .
