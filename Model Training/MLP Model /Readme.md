# Intrusion Detection System using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
This project implements a neural network model to detect and classify network intrusions from the NSL-KDD dataset. The model is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a robust classifier that can distinguish between normal network traffic and various types of cyber attacks. The script performs the following key tasks:

Data Loading: Ingests the NSL-KDD training and testing datasets.

Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the data by encoding categorical features and scaling numerical values.

Model Building: Constructs a Sequential MLP model using Keras.

Training: Trains the model on the preprocessed training data.

Evaluation: Assesses the model's performance on the test set and generates a classification report and a confusion matrix.

## ðŸ’¾ Dataset
This model is trained on the NSL-KDD Dataset, a benchmark dataset for intrusion detection research.

KDDTrain+.txt: The training dataset.

KDDTest+.txt: The testing dataset.

Both files are included in this directory for easy setup and execution.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure
The project directory is structured as follows:

â”œâ”€â”€ malware_detection_model.py   # The main Python script for training and evaluation                    
â”œâ”€â”€ KDDTrain+.txt                # Training dataset file                                                      
â”œâ”€â”€ KDDTest+.txt                 # Testing dataset file                                                            
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt             # A list of required Python libraries                              
â””â”€â”€ confusion_matrix.png         # The output image generated by the script

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or newer
pip (Python package installer)

### Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/thedarknight01/Intrusion-Detection-System.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Intrusion-Detection-System/Model\ Training/MLP\ Model/
```
Install the required libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
ðŸ’¡Once the setup is complete, you can run the model training and evaluation script.

ðŸ“Š Expected Output
The script will produce the following:

Console Output: You will see the model's summary, training progress for 20 epochs, and a final classification report showing precision, recall, and F1-scores for each attack category.

Confusion Matrix Image: A file named confusion_matrix.png will be saved in the directory. This image visually represents the model's performance in classifying the different attack types.
