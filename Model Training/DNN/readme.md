# Intrusion Detection System using a Deep Neural Network

This project contains a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model designed for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The model is trained on the CSE-CIC-IDS 2018 dataset to classify network traffic and identify potential intrusions.

## ðŸ“œ Dataset

The model was trained on the **CSE-CIC-IDS 2018** dataset. This is a comprehensive and realistic dataset for evaluating intrusion detection systems.

* **Official Source:** [University of New Brunswick (UNB)](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html)
* **Kaggle Version:** [IDS 2018 on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solarmainframe/ids-intrusion-csv)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [your-repository-name]
```

### 2. Create Environment & Install Dependencies
It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
# venv\Scripts\activate
# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the Dataset
Download the `cleaned_ids2018_sampled.csv` file from Kaggle and place it in a directory (e.g., `data/`). You will need to update the `DATA_PATH` variable in `train.py` to point to its location.

### 4. Train the Model
Run the training script. This will process the data, train the model, and save `best_ids_model.keras`, `scaler.joblib`, and `label_encoder.joblib`.

```bash
python train.py
```

### 5. Make Predictions
Use the `predict.py` script to classify new network traffic data. The script requires a path to a CSV file containing the data to be classified.

```bash
python predict.py --file /path/to/your/unseen_data.csv
```
